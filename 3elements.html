          <p>Film depends on many elements to create a story and a specific effect. The meticulous manipulation of these elements aim to achieve a specific mood and point to the audience. Most of these elements can also be referred to as “mise en scene”. It roughly translates to “putting on the stage.” Below are a lsit of these elements.

            <ul class="elements_tab_li">
              <h4 class="tabs_p">The Setting's function is to depict space, time, and place.</h4> 
              <p class="tabs_p">Typically, the setting is chosen for obvious expositional reasons, but depending on the caliber of the film and the auteur, setting can be as acutely and deliberately chosen as other elements such as dialogue, lighting, or acting.</p> 
              <p class="tabs_p">For example, being stuck in a box in which you have 1 inch room all around could be symbolic of the subject's psychology.</p>
              <p class="tabs_p">In some cases, setting can become personified and the audience grows to care for it- like a great ship sinking. </p>
              <h4 class="tabs_p">Costume, props, amd makeup are usually directly correlated in film; they assist in reinforcing a time period, a character's personality or status, thematic differences between other characters, or special effects (SFX). </h4>
              <h4 class="tabs_p">The style and quality of a figure's performance or acting serves as the medium to tell the story through their choices.</h4>
              <p class="tabs_p">The two most common styles of acting are method acting, in which actors blend their reality with the characters' in order to "be" the part, and non-method acting, where the actor overacts or hyperbolizes certain characteristics to dramatize or undercut for a specific effect.</p>
              <h4 class="tabs_p">Blocking refers to the internal placement of characters within the frame.</h4>
              <p class="tabs_p">Common symbolic effects are dominance, inferiority, and unity. Blocking is important because it directs the viewer's attention to where the director wants you to look, and what they want you to feel.</p>
              <h4 class="tabs_p">Lighting is a core element that affects the mood and feel of a scene.</h4>
              <p class="tabs_p">The most common kind of lighting is the Three Point Lighting, consisting of a backlight, fill light, and a key light. Other very common lighting techniques are High-Key Lighting and Low-Key Lighting. These are inverse techniques. High-Key Lighting creates an even illumination, giving the whole scene a soft and bright look, with little shadows. Low-Key Lighting is the direct opposite, in which shadows are pushed and the contrast between light and dark is prominent. This is most often seen in film noir, dark dramas, or mystery films.</p>
            </ul>

        <input type="radio" name="tabs" id="tabtwo">

        <div class="tab">
          <ul class="elements_tab_li">
            <h4 class="tabs_p">Camera Framing and Angle, similar to blocking, is the intentional placement of objects in the frame. However, here, it's more specific to the distance and position of the camera to the subject.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">Some of the most common framing examples are wide, long, medium, close up, and over-the-shoulder shots. Some effects that intentional framing can achieve are loneliness, power, tension, or anxiety. Certain framing can also help the audience feel the performance better. For example, if the intention is to gain emotional connection to a character during an emotional scene, a close-up may be better suited to achieve that effect than a wide shot.</p>
            <h4 class="tabs_p">the camera is the perspective of the audience. Therefore, the way the camera moves influences our experience of the scene.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">One great example is the Vertigo effect: pushing the camera either forward or backwards, while you zoom in or out in the opposite direction. Although coined from Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film <em>Vertigo</em>, one of the most memorableness of the Vertigo shot is from Bill Vutler's 1975 <em>Jaws.</em></em> </p>

        <input type="radio" name="tabs" id="tabthree">
        <label for="tabthree">SOUND/ MUSIC</label>
        <div class="tab">
          <ul class="elements_tab_li">
            <h4 class="tabs_p">Musical score is the original music that accompanies a film. Sound contributes to the mood and overall emotion of the film in the way visual elements can not. It is equally important as it its sister counterparts.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">Film composers are typically hired for these productions. Musical score differs from a film's soundtrack; the score is intentional music that accompanies a scene or moment, and can include some dialogue or other sounds from the film, and is traditionally instrumental. The soundtrack typical features vocal music performed by hired singers or bands, and does not have to be featured in the film.</p>
            <h4 class="tabs_p">Foley is the creation of sound effects not produced from the scene.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">Typically, a person is hired to create and record foley sounds by watching a scene and creating sound effects with objects to match the visual movements. Foley is most often used in animated films.</p>
            <h4 class="tabs_p">Production, or direct sound, is sound from the scene's atmosphere.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">This is an incredibly important and often overlooked support to other auditory elements. Production sound helps a scene feel natural and keeps the audience within the film's reality. This is not limited to background sounds of noisy scenes (such as a city); even those that call for an awkward silences have some kind of room noise, like the humming of a fan, or a breeze coming from an open window.</p>
            <h4 class="tabs_p">Dialogue is one of the three main sounds you hear in film, and is partly the responsibility of the talent's performance, but also from the editing and casting departments.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">For example, Morgan Freeman is commonly known for his quality of dialogue, and is often sought after for narration roles.</p>

        <label for="tabfour">EDITING</label>
        <div class="tab">
          <ul class="elements_tab_li">
            <h4 class="tabs_p">Pacing and cutting are very unique to film. The rate of movement and flow of events affect the speed at which the plot moves.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">Cutting is similar to camera movement, but can only be done through editing; it is the choice of how long to stay on subject, and when to "cut to" a different subject or scene. Cutting is also very unique to film, as some effects will not land on the audience if not done properly. One of the greatest example is the cutting used in the US adaptation mockumentary sitcom <em>The Office.</em>The show is heavily known for cutting from one subject's action to another subject's reaction while zooming in on their faces.</p>
            <h4 class="tabs_p">Continuity is the blending of multiple shots into a seamless and consistent narrative.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">This helps achieve realism and keeps the audience grounded in the time and space of the film. It is commonly said that the goal of continuity editing is to not be noticed. </p>
            <h4 class="tabs_p">Editing the color of a scene is known as color grading. If you are editing the color to correct something, it is known as color correcting.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">Color correcting is usually done first to unify clips by fixing issues with the color of the footage. From there, you will have an even canvas to work on color grading. Correcting is a balance; grading is a look. One of the greatest examples of great color grading are Wes Anderson films. For hues, Anderson commonly features primary colors like red, blue, and yellow. He also tends to push the saturation and brightness as high as possible, making wardrobe, background, makeup, or props stand out. </p>
            <h4 class="tabs_p">Quality sound depends heavily on the way is it recorded, mastered, and mixed.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">Sound editing begins even before recording happens. There are different sound-capturing tools to choose from like boom mics, shotgun mics, and lavalier mics. One important way sound is used is the slate, also known as a clapper. After the director calls "action", the camera will start recording and the person handling the slate will announce the scene, the take number and then "clap" the slate. The reason this is done is so that the editors can have a visual mark of when the scene starts, and are able to keep the sound and visual movement in sync. In editing, they can manipulate the sound levels and add any effects tailored to the scene. </p>

        <div class="tab">
          <ul class="elements_tab_li">
            <h4 class="tabs_p">The written work for a film is called a screenplay.</h4>
            <p class="tabs_p">This is the first part of a film's production. Many are completely original, but it is also very common for writers to create adaptations of books for the big screen. A screenplay consists of classic attributes such as exposition and dialogue, but also includes details of what type of shot to use, how the camera should be moving, or notes on how the actor should play a scene. It also has a special writing format for each of these attributes.</p>
