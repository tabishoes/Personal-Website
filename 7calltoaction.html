    <h3>It is our responsibility, for better or for worse, to publish art that is ethical, progressive, and teaches us to be better. 
        It is also our responsibility to be thoughtful about the media we choose to consume and make successful. 
        This is especially true in a world where media export, consumption, and influence is inescapable. </h3>

    <p id="pg7_quote">“Say who you are, really say it in your life and in your work. Tell someone out there who is lost, someone not yet born, someone who won't be born for 500 years. 
        Your writing will be a record of your time. It can't help but be that. 
        But more importantly, if you're honest about who you are, you'll help that person be less lonely in their world because that person will recognise him or herself in you and that will give them hope.”</p>
