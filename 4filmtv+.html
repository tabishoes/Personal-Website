                <h4>Movies</h4>
                <p>The earliest categorical movie is actually not a movie at all. Eadweard Muybridge, a pioneer photographer, was hired in 1878 to settle a controversy of whether or not all the feet of a trotting horse were clear of the ground in the same instant.</p> 
                <p>For this experiment, he constructed a track and set up multiple cameras connected to a wire, each stretched across the track. As the race horse ran, each camera was triggered to capture an instant in time.</p> 
                <p>In the end, the series of photos proved that indeed, the feet of a trotting horse were clear of the ground in the same instant, but only when they were under the horse's body.</p>
                <p>Following the photographs, in 1880 The Horse in Motion was made by compiling the photos and projecting it onto a zoopraxiscope disc, creating the illusion of a moving horse.</p>

                <h4>TV Shows</h4>
                <P>The first tv show was made in 1928 and was titled The Queen's Messenger by J. Harley Manners. It was first aired on September 11, 1928 in Schenectady, New York. TV series differ from films because they are not novels (though they can be inspired by them).</P> 
                <p>They are also not as short, allowing for a story to unfold over weeks, months, or years, giving room for more complexities.</p>
                <p>This experience has made a lasting impact in our moving media consumption and preferences. We now turn to TV series more than films.</p>
                <p>According to a 2022 Hollywood Reporter poll, “among 2,200 adults, only 27% named movie theaters as their primary entertainment venue after pandemic shutdowns eased. The majority- 58% -said watching TV shows at home is now their top pastime.</p> 
                <p>Per Nielson data, American viewers averaged nearly 8 hours watching streaming shows daily during lockdowns- but just 12 minutes watching movies.”</p>
                <p>It could be said that long, concentrated narratives have helped us during our loneliest times.</P>

                <h4>Anime & Animation</h4>
                <p>Anime has had one of the biggest rises in motion media. Anime is an abbreviation of the word “animation”.</p>
                <p>In the West, anime is associated with a specific Japanese style of animation. </p>
                <p>However, in Japan the word anime (アニメ) is synonymous with animation of any kind and from anywhere.</p>
                <p>The first-ever anime is widely debated upon. However, the characteristics of the anime art style we know today first emerged in the 1960s through the works of Osamu Tezuka, with notable creations like Astro Boy.</p> 
                <p> Animation is free from the laws of physics and logic of real life, giving it great rage and a unique flavor.</p>

                <h4>Music videos</h4>
                <P>The first music video is highly debated, but one of the earliest and most revolutionary modern music videos was made and published by the Beatles in 1965 as a solution to make live shows to sell to all companies that wanted one.</P> 
                <p>The Golden Age of music videos is generally agreed to be from the 1990's to early 2000's. </p>
                <p>This form of moving media caters to music, but is usually accompanied by a narrative.</P>

                <h4>YouTube videos & Games</h4>
                <p>When YouTube launched its beta version in May of 2005, the site was gaining about 30,000 visitors daily. On Dec 15 of the same year, YouTube officially launched and was serving 2 million viewers daily.</p>
                <P>Arguably, YouTube made other platforms possible, like Vine, Tiller, and TikTok, all due to one feature: the user's autonomy of creation.</P>
                <p>Because of this, moving media broke limits on the type of content put out into the world. The most popular categories being education, tutorials, vlogs, gaming, reviews, and podcasts, to name a few.</p>
                <p>Video games brought a cultural shift with the release of arcade games, portable consoles, and even Virtual Reality.</p>
                <p>Approximately 3.32 billion people are active gamers today.</p>
