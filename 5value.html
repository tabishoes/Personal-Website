                   <p><em>Coraline</em> is an important gothic animated adaptation based on another gothic novel by Neil Gailmam. Gothic narratives are important in children's literature.</p>

                        <li>
                           "Gothicism has always been an integral part of children't literature... To come into contact with 
                           monsters and ghosts is vital and necessary to our mental and physical growth because as we grow older
                        we discover that these strange  shapes and intense situations often embody our individual fears and anxieties."</li>
                        <li>"Gothicism is just as applicable to children as it is to adults. There is no emotion 
                           specific to adults and... children and adults possess the same fears, but those fears take on 
                           different forms depending on one's age and maturity."
                        </li>
                        <li>"Subconsciously, childresn may perceive a story's gothic tone, recognize the emotions manufactures by the mood
                           or characters or setting, and begin to cogitate on why they are responding to the literature."
                        </li>
                        <li>Gothic conetent within both the book and the film contributes to undermining the idealization of Coraline's family, her own process of growing up, 
                           and he coping with moving to a completely different place."
                        </li>
